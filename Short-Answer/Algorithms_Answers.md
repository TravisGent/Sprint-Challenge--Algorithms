## Exercise I

a) O(n)
It looks like if you were to give this really big numbers it would really take some time for it to catch up and could quickly end up taking too much time.

b) O(n log n)
It shouldn't have really any problems with the while loop inside, even with really large numbers. Doubleing what j is every single loop means that j will get pretty large pretty quickly. But the for loop could end up taking it some time because it will run for every value in some pretty big numbers. 

c) O(n)
It seems to be doubleing whatever number you pass into it, but in a really odd way. It can end up taking some time based on what I can see by looking at it.
